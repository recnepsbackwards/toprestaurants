# Top 10 Restaurants Website

#Goal:

To learn responsive web design so that scales down to mobile screen size correctly.

#What I learned:

How to use float in css to stack content as the window is re-sized.

#What I would like to accomplish in the future:

Design a better color scheme. The green on green is a bit much, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.

Add a navigation bar.
